** What's included

The config is modular: see ~imports~ in =home.nix= for disabling parts of it.

- =config.nix=: `nix-env` configuration: allowing unfree packages, etc.
- =email.nix=: email applications and accounts.
  I mostly rely on =mbsync= to sync my email, and keep my passwords in =gopass=.
- =packages.nix=: a list of packages that don't require additional configuration.
- =programs=: stuff that you run by hand.
- =services=: stuff that runs in the background and you don't think about it.
- =themes.nix=: GTK and Qt theme configuration.
