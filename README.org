* nixos-home
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
dotfiles for Nix + home-manager (mostly for NixOS)
#+END_QUOTE

** What's included
The config is modular: see ~imports~ in =home.nix= for disabling parts of it.

- =config.nix=: =nix-env= configuration: allowing unfree packages, etc.
- =email.nix=: email applications and accounts.
  I mostly rely on =mbsync= to sync my email, and keep my passwords in =gopass=.
- =packages.nix=: a list of packages that don't require additional configuration.
- =programs=: stuff that you run by hand.
- =services=: stuff that runs in the background and you don't think about it.
- =themes.nix=: GTK and Qt theme configuration.

** Installation
*** NixOS
1. Add =git= and =home-manager= to your ~environment.systemPackages~:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
{
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ git home-manager ];
}
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
#+END_SRC
2. Clone this repo:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
